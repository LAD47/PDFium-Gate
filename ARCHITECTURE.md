# PDFium Gate architecture

`ARCHITECTURE.md` is the stable entry point to the project architecture. Detailed contracts are split by domain under `docs/architecture/` so contributors can read and change one area without navigating one monolithic file.

## Architectural status

- Foundational runtime architecture reached its intended structural target in 0.1.180 and remains the rollback/runtime reference.
- `src/` is the authoritative production source; root runtime files are generated release artifacts.
- Cross-feature behavior uses explicit operation ports and one canonical owner.
- Ambiguous PDF/runtime identity fails closed.
- Markdown/YAML and explicit configuration files are persistent source of truth; RAM indexes/caches are derived.
- Factory-created persistent defaults are canonical English; i18n owns UI presentation only.

## Documentation map

1. [Architecture overview](docs/architecture/01-overview.md) — supported runtime, source of truth, composition roots and baselines.

3. [Runtime boundaries and production dataflow](docs/architecture/03-runtime-boundaries.md) — Electron main ↔ renderer ↔ annotator communication.
4. [Electron Main Bridge](docs/architecture/04-main-bridge.md) — physical wrapper/input/lifecycle ownership.
5. [PDF viewer identity and lifecycle](docs/architecture/05-pdf-viewer.md) — identity, RuntimeDriver and wrapper readiness.

## Change rule

Update the smallest owning architecture document when a contract changes. Update this index only when the document map or top-level architectural status changes. Foundational runtime refactoring still requires a concrete product/platform need and corresponding verifier coverage; documentation splitting itself does not authorize structural runtime cleanup.
